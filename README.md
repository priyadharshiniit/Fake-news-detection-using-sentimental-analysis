This Fake news detection project consist the technology of implementing fake news using sentimental analaysis. Sentimental analysis is achieved through the technology of Text Blob that is a open source python library for processing textual data and providing results in sentimental score whether positive, neutral or negative.
Text is preprocessed using NLTK( Natural Language Toolkit ) by process of tokenization, Lemmatization and removal of stopwords. The machine is trained and tested using ML algorithms like Naive bayes, Random forest and Logistic regression algorithm. 
Comparing to all these 3 algorithm the accuracy score for Naive Bayes was greater. To predict the dynamic news from news website such as Times of India and Google news i used Pygooglenews from google news api to fetch news from google. 
So by using all these algorithm. Every day's news can be fetched and predicted whether its fake or real news.
